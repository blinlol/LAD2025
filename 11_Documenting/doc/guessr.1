guessr \- binary guessing game that can speak Roman numerals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B guessr
.RI [ -r ]
.RI [ --help ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guessr
plays a classic binary-search guessing game: the computer tries to deduce the
number you picked between 1 and 100 by asking Yes/No questions. Answers must
match the localized strings "Yes" and "No" so gettext-enabled translations
continue to function.
.PP
When the
.B -r
flag is supplied every prompt, question, and the final answer are presented in
Roman numerals. Internally the program still operates on decimal values and the
roman table is limited to the 1\-100 range.
